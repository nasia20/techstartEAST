our project is making posters for when the colleges come to visit our school. its posted on every lunch shift and you can talk to them at lunch

i call my project "college posters" because we make posters for the colleges, we did alot so far this year and we posted them all around school. we also put them on the walls by the cafeteria so people at lunch can see them.
